      <h2>Quote:</h2>
      <p2 style="font-size:14.5px"><i><q>Chess is far too complex to be definitively
      solved with any technology we can conceive of today. However, our looked-down-upon
      cousin, checkers, or draughts, suffered this fate quite recently thanks to the
      work of Jonathan Schaeffer at the University of Alberta and his unbeatable program
      Chinook.</i></q></p2>
